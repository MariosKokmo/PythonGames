# PythonGames
Some python games that have been created as an excercise.
The games' code originally belongs to their respective authors and have been a follow-along exercise from freecodecamp.org

The intention is to experiment with the code.

Most of the games require the Pygame library to be installed. Space Invaders is a simple instantiation of the classic game and is merely intended for experimentation. You can run the game through the *run.py* file.
